# Bayesian Model Averaging of Longitudinal Dose-Response Models

This github repository contains the code to reproduce the examples and simulations presented in the paper entitled "Bayesian Model Averaging of Longitudinal Dose-Response Models" which has been accepted in the *Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics*.

The case study code can be found in the `case_study.R` file.  The simulations in the paper utilize a `targets` pipeline.  Please see the [Targets Manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) for details on how to run a `targets` pipeline.  The `paper_figures.R`, `paper_stats.R`, and `paper_tables.R` provide the majority of figures, statistics, and tables in the paper.
